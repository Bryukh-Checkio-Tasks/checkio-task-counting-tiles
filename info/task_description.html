    Nicola decided to build a round landing zone using the ice square tiles. The landing zone must be circular. But
    Nicola has to know how many tiles he needed for construction.
</p>
<p>
    The square tile has size 1x1 meter. You need to calculate how many to solid and partial tiles for circle with radius
    N meters. The center of the circle is at the intersection of tiles. For example: For the circle with radius 2 metres
    need 4 solid and 12 partial tiles.

<p><strong>Input:</strong> Radius of circle, a float</p>

<p><strong>Output:</strong> Two numbers of quantities solid and partial tiles as a list, [solid, partial]</p>
